# Market Maker - OOP Java Project

This is a Java-based market simulation project developed for an Object-Oriented Software Development (OOSD) course. The program demonstrates foundational OOP principles through the design of a simplified market maker system.

## üß† Project Purpose

The goal of this project is to simulate how a market maker interacts with buyers and sellers in a financial market. It includes components for price setting, transaction handling, and order book management ‚Äî all structured using solid object-oriented design practices.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

- Implements key OOP principles: abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism
- Interface-driven design for modularity and extensibility
- Centralized market-making logic to simulate real-world financial interactions
- Console-based user interaction for running trade scenarios
